This project ended up moving beyond the scope of Simon.  I added a connect four clone after making Simon pretty.
The homepage contains links to each game.
PerSimon (since my Simon clone looks like a flower) has multiple difficulty options and a high score board with 5 slots.
Kinect Four has one and two player game modes, a score tracker, custom player names, and a score reset.
I wanted to make these games feel very relaxed and each has it's own theme music that the user can toggle on and off.

In order to complete this project I used three songs:
Cliffs by Aphex Twin,
A Paw in My Face by The Field,
1/2 by Brian Eno.

I also used jquery in this project.
